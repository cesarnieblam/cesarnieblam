### 1. Setup your platform
   - python 3.10
   - pip
   - git
   - ffmpeg
   - visual studio 2022 runtimes (windows)

### 2. Clone Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/roop
```

### 3. Install dependencies

We highly recommend to work with a `venv` to avoid issues.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Done

You should be able to run roop using `python run.py` command. Keep in mind that while running the program for first time, it will download some models which can take time depending on your network connection.
