6. Download [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eu60OrRtn4WhKrzM4mQv4F3rIuyUXqfl/view?usp=drive_link) and keep it in **roop** directory. [Mirror #1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jbDUGrADco9A1MutWjO6d_1dwizh9w9P/view?usp=sharing), [Mirror #2](https://mega.nz/file/9l8mGDJA#FnPxHwpdhDovDo6OvbQjhHd2nDAk8_iVEgo3mpHLG6U), [Mirror #3](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsHA3Xbnj6uAgxhb_tmQ7egHACOR?e=CPoThO), [Mirror #4](https://civitai.com/models/80324?modelVersionId=85159). Rename it to `inswapper_128.onnx` if it isn't already.
