If you aren't good with following commands, here's a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/OI1LEN-SgLM)

1. install `python` (and `pip` too if neeed)
2. install `git`
3. install `ffmpeg`
4. If you are on Windows, install Visual Studio 2022 (with desktop development C++).
4. `git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/roop`
5. `cd roop && pip install -r requirements.txt`

Done. You should be able to use this software with `python run.py` command.

> Keep in mind that while running the program for first time, it will download some models.
