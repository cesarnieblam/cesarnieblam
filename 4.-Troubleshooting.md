### Falsy Dependencies resolution

Make sure to run Python 3.10 to prevent dependencies conflicts.

### Runtime errors during processing

A `Non zero status code...` or `Cannot allocate memory...` during processing results in lost frames and indicate that your GPU is out of VRAM or just overwhelmed - you need to lower the `--execution-threads` to 1 and increase it slowly.

### No module named 'xxx'

A `ModuleNotFoundError` indicates that the dependencies have not been correctly installed.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Module 'xxx' has no attribute 'xxx'

A `AttributeError` indicates that the dependencies have not been correctly installed.

### NoneType object has no attribute shape

Make sure to remove special characters and unicodes in `-s/--source-path`, `-t/--target-path` and `-o/--output-path` arguments.

### Solution to most OpenCV errors

In most cases it helps to reinstall OpenCV.

```
pip uninstall opencv-python opencv-python-headless
pip install opencv-python
```

### Solution to most Protobuf errors

In most cases it helps to reinstall all dependencies that provide a model like `insightface` and `opennsfw2`.

### DNN library is not found

Make sure to have the latest CuDNN runtime installed as some library might be compiled with a higher version.

### Only CPU is processing

Do not install `onnxruntime` and `onnxruntime-xxx` at the same time, otherwise only `CPUExecutionProvider` will run.

```
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-xxx
pip install onnxruntime-xxx
```

### Blank UI under MacOS

Either use a `venv` like suggested or update the global tkinter version of your platform.

```
brew install python-tk@3.10
```

### Illegal instruction

This might be caused by a missing instruction set of your CPU. You can either compile tensorflow from source or downgrade it.

```
pip install tensorflow@1.5
```

### Progress stucked

You probably triggered the NSFW filter and the application stopped processing.

### Preview crashed

You probably triggered the NSFW filter and the application closed itself.
