### Falsy Dependencies resolution

Make sure to run Python 3.10 to prevent dependencies conflicts.

### Runtime errors during processing

A `Non zero status code...` or `Cannot allocate memory...` during processing results in lost frames and indicate that your GPU is out of VRAM or just overwhelmed - you need to lower the `--execution-threads` to 1 and increase it slowly.

### No module named 'xxx'

A `ModuleNotFoundError` indicates that the dependencies have not been correctly installed.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Module 'xxx' has no attribute 'xxx'

A `AttributeError` indicates that the dependencies have not been correctly installed.

### Solution to most OpenCV errors

In most cases it helps to reinstall OpenCV.

```
pip uninstall opencv-python opencv-python-headless
pip install opencv-python
```

### Solution to most Protobuf errors

In most cases it helps to reinstall all dependencies that provide a model like `insightface` and `opennsfw2`.

### Only CPU is processing

Do not install `onnxruntime` and `onnxruntime-xxx` at the same time, otherwise only `CPUExecutionProvider` will run.

```
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-xxx
pip install onnxruntime-xxx
```
